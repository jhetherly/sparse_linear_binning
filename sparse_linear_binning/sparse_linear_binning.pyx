    """Perform a linear binning on weighted data (optimized for sparsity)

    This algorithm is able to operate on N data point in D dimensions and
    produces a variable number of grid points, G, with their corresponding
    weights.
    The input arrays need to be c-contiguous and strictly adhere to the
    required types (double and unsigned long).

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : 2D numpy array with shape (N, D) of type double
        data coordinates
    weights : 1D numpy array with shape (N) of type double
        data weights
    extents : 2D numpy array with shape (D, 2) of type double
        limits of grid (all data outside this rectangular region is under- or
        overflow)
    sizes : 1D numpy array with shape (D) of type unsigned long
        number of bin centers (grid points) in each dimension

    Returns
    -------
    2D numpy array with shape (G, D) of type double
        grid points with non-zero weights
    1D numpy array with shape (N) of type double
        weights at the corresponding grid points
